# Semaphores and mutexes example
Semaphores and Mutexes are very alike. The main difference is that mutexes are binary variables, assuming two states: locked or unlocked. In turn, semaphores can work with any non-negative value (i. e., values greater than or equal to zero). So, when a semaphore reaches zero, it will lock the thread.
